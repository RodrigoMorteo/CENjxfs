# J/XFS Standard Implementation (Work in Progress)

This project provides **scaffolding and base classes** for implementing the **J/eXtensions for Financial Services (J/XFS) standard** for the Java Platform. J/XFS aims to provide a **hardware-independent and operating system-independent API** for Java applications to access financial devices such as card readers, PIN keypads, cash dispensers, and printers. This implementation follows the specifications defined by the **CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA) 16008 series**.

**Please Note: This Project is a Work in Progress**

This project is currently in its early stages and should be considered a **work in progress**. Development is proceeding **slowly due to time constraints**. While some base classes and scaffolding are in place, **a complete and fully functional implementation is not yet available**.

**Contributions Welcome**

Contributions to this project are **welcomed and encouraged**! If you have expertise in the J/XFS standard or are interested in helping to build this implementation, please feel free to submit Pull Requests (PRs).

**Important: No Guarantee of PR Acceptance**

While contributions are appreciated, please understand that due to the ongoing and potentially evolving nature of this project, there is **no guarantee that all submitted Pull Requests will be accepted**. The maintainer reserves the right to make decisions based on the project's direction and compatibility with the existing codebase.
