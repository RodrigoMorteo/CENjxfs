*   Status                  Meaning
    JXFS_S_CLAIMED          Sent if the device was claimed.
    JXFS_S_RELEASED         Sent if the device was just released by a Device Control which had claimed the device.
    JXFS_S_HARDWAREERROR    Sent if a hardware error was detected by the Device Service.
    JXFS_S_USERACTIONERROR  Sent if an error was detected which is resolvable by user intervention. If a more specific JxfsStatusEvent is generated regarding the error (e.g. a TONER_OUT) then NO additional event with this id is sent.
    JXFS_S_WORKING          Sent if an error has been fixed to indicate that the device is working again.
    JXFS_S_SHUTDOWN         The device service has completed its shutdown and is not usable any more.
    JXFS_S_REMOTEFAILURE    The communication between DS and DC is broken; device is not accessible any more.
    JXFS_S_POWERSAVEON      Device is gone into power save mode.
    JXFS_S_POWERSAVEOFF     Device has returned from power save mode.
    JXFS_S_MANIPULATION     The device service detected a manipulation.
    JXFS_S_NO_MANIPULATION  The manipulation state has ended and the device is normal again. Some manipulation sensors require vendor specific functionality to reset the manipulation state. Therefore not all devices that join the manipulation state can also leave that state automatically.
