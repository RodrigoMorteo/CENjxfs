/*
* This is a class any J/XFS class which contains data should inherit from. This can be the data objects delivered within some events or any other complex object which serves as an input or output parameter for Device Control methods.
* This is needed to ensure the streamability of any data class used in J/XFS because any data object might be streamed over a network connection and must be stored in the repository in its binary format.
* Java base data types like String, int, etc. are streamable anyway and thus may be used as parameters without putting them into special wrapper classes.
