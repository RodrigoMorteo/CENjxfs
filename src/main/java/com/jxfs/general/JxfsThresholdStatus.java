/*
* This class defines a generic API to query and detect several threshold values. This can be 
* e.g. the paper supply present in a printer (to detect if itâ€™s low or empty) or the retain bin of
* a card reader (to detect if its full or almost full).
* This object is received by the application either by calling getStatus() and querying the
* device specific status object or via certain JxfsStatusEvents. The state given by an object of
* this type reflects the state of the device at the time of its sending, i.e. the state may already
* have changed again. It is always only filled by the Device Service.
