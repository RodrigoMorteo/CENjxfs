	 * Implementing the "Property" Concept in J/XFS
	The sources don't define a specific Property class. Instead, they use the term "Property" to refer to device characteristics or settings that can be accessed using getProperty and setProperty methods. The implementation of a "Property" in the J/XFS context would depend on the specific property being handled and the programming language used for the implementation.
	Understanding "Properties" in J/XFS
	● Device Characteristics: "Properties" often represent inherent features or states of a device. For example:
		○ supportedFDKeys (source): A vector of supported function descriptor keys for a PIN Keypad device.
		○ deviceType (source): An integer indicating the type of Magnetic Stripe & Chip Card device (swipe, dip, motorized).
	● Device Settings: Some "Properties" are configurable settings that control device behavior. For example:
		○ activeFDKeys (source): A selection of function descriptor keys that are currently enabled for a PIN Keypad device.
		○ autoEnd (source): A boolean specifying whether a PIN entry operation should automatically end after a certain condition is met.
	● Access Control: "Properties" can have different access levels, typically "R" (read-only), "W" (write-only), or "R/W" (read-write), indicating the permitted operations on them.
	● Data Types: "Properties" can have various data types, including integers, booleans, strings, byte arrays, and custom J/XFS classes.
	● Dynamic Nature: The value of a "Property" may change during device operation, for instance, the mediaStatus (source) might change from "not present" to "present" when a card is inserted.
	
	Implementing "Properties"
	The implementation would involve representing these "Properties" as data members within the relevant J/XFS classes and providing getProperty and setProperty methods to access and modify them. Here's a general outline:
	1. Data Members: Define data members within the appropriate class to hold the property values. For example, in a class representing a PIN Keypad device, you might have:
	2. getProperty Method: Implement a getProperty method that takes a property identifier (e.g., a string or an enum value) as input and returns the corresponding property value.
	3. setProperty Method: Implement a setProperty method that takes a property identifier and the new value as input and updates the corresponding data member.
	4. Access Control: Enforce access control based on the property's read/write permissions. You might raise exceptions (like JXFS_E_ACCESS_DENIED) if a read-only property is being written to or vice versa.
	5. Data Validation: Implement data validation within setProperty to ensure the new value is valid for the specific property. For instance, you might check if an integer value is within an acceptable range.
	6. Device Communication: If a property change affects the device, the implementation should translate this change into appropriate commands sent to the device.
	7. Event Handling: If a property change triggers an event, the implementation should generate and send the corresponding J/XFS event to the application.
	Additional Considerations
	● JavaBeans Conventions: In Java, you can adhere to JavaBeans conventions by providing get and set methods for each property. For example, for the autoEnd property:
	● Language-Specific Features: Utilize language-specific features that can simplify property handling. For example, in Python, you could use decorators or property descriptors.
	
	Example Scenario: Property
	Let's consider the mediaStatus property of a Card Reader device. This property might be implemented as an enum with values like NOT_PRESENT, PRESENT, JAMMED. The getProperty method would return the current mediaStatus, while the setProperty method wouldn't be applicable as this property is read-only. Changes to the mediaStatus would be triggered by device events, and the Device Service would generate and send corresponding J/XFS events to the application.
	Summary
	The concept of a "Property" in J/XFS is a flexible mechanism for representing device characteristics and settings. The implementation details would depend on the specific property and the programming language used. The general approach involves defining data members, implementing getProperty and setProperty methods, handling access control and data validation, and potentially managing device communication and event generation.
